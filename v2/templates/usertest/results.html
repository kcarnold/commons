<h1>Thank you!</h1>
<p>
Thank you for your time. Now we'll show you where each of the statements came
from.
</p>
<p>
Some of these statements were user-contributed knowledge that directly from our
semantic network, ConceptNet. Others were inferred from other knowledge, and
others were just random nonsense. We ran all the statements through the same
sentence-generation process.
