<h2>Welcome to Open Mind Common Sense!</h2>

<p>Computers don't currently know the basic things about the world that we consider "common sense." Here, you can help build a database of such knowledge in simple English sentences. The computer will analyze these sentences to connect concepts and draw new conclusions from the things you teach it.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>If you want to interact with OpenMind and teach it new things, <b><a href="/account/login">log in</a>
 to get started!</b></p>

<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>
This project, Open Mind Common Sense, enables computers to learn general knowledge from ordinary people
 over the Web. It is the product of ongoing research by the <a href="http://csc.media.mit.edu/">Commonsense Computing Initiative</a> at the MIT Media Lab. You can find related projects that other groups are
 working on at <a href="http://openmind.org/">OpenMind.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
The information collected by this site becomes part of <a href="http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu/">ConceptNet</a>, an open-source, multilingual semantic network of general knowledge. The reasoning is powered
 by <a href="http://divisi.media.mit.edu/">Divisi</a>, a tool for reasoning by analogy over semantic networks.
