# ConceptNet 3 documentation build configuration file, created by

# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its containing dir.
#
# The contents of this file are pickled, so don't put values in the namespace
# that aren't pickleable (module imports are okay, they're removed automatically).
#
# All configuration values have a default value; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default value.

# is relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it
# absolute, like shown here.

# General configuration
# ---------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be extensions
# coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom ones.
