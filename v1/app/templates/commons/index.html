Use "maincontent" instead of "content" so we can control where the title goes.

<h1>Welcome to Open Mind Common Sense!</h1>

<p>Computers don't currently know the basic things about the world that we consider "common sense." Here, you can help build a database of such knowledge in simple English sentences. The computer will analyze these sentences to connect concepts and draw new conclusions from the things you teach it.</p>

<h2>New site</h2>
<p>We've upgraded the Web interface to Open Mind Common Sense! This one will
keep running at <i>commons.media.mit.edu</i>, but the new site is currently up
at <b><a
href="http://openmind.media.mit.edu">openmind.media.mit.edu</a></b>.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>To browse, type a word or two into the "Search" box, click a link on the sidebar, or <a href="{{best_url}}">see the highest-rated statements</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with OpenMind and teach it new things, <b><a href="{{login_url}}">log in</a> to get started!</b></p>

<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>
This project, Open Mind Common Sense, enables computers to learn general knowledge from ordinary people over the Web. It is the product of ongoing research by the <a href="http://csc.media.mit.edu/">Commonsense Computing Initiative</a> at the MIT Media Lab. You can find related projects that other groups are working on at <a href="http://openmind.org/">OpenMind.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
The information collected by this site becomes part of <a href="http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu/">ConceptNet</a>, an open-source, multilingual semantic network of general knowledge. The reasoning is powered by <a href="http://divisi.media.mit.edu/">Divisi</a>, a tool for reasoning by analogy over semantic networks.
